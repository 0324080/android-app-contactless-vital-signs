Compile APK.\r\n2. Run on physical device.\r\n3. There will be 6-8 options to choose from, choose one of the top two choices for either the back-facing camera or front-facing camera.\r\n4. Center a face on the screen and watch the numbers count down.\r\n5. Either the current heart rate will be show or an error message will show if there wasn't a good reading. Lighting is important for this app.\r\n6. To have accurate **blood pressure**, click on the stats that are on the lower-right corner of the screen. A popup will appear so that you can edit the weight, height, age, gender, et cetera.\r\n7. To get **body temperature**, first get the external body temperature (via IR thermometer), then input that along with ambient temperature to get body temperature.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Other options on the main page of the app may crash the app depending on what device is being used. A few of the choices are just mockups on how other vital signs would be calculated.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nBelow is not used. It is from the GitHub template.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish.After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
